# TV-Script-Generation
Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree Project

This repository is part of a core project in Udacity's Deep Learning Nanodegree.
The script uses a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) cells and trains on a series of TV scripts as input data.
After training, the script will be able to generate its own TV script with a prime word as input.
